**THE STORY** 

You were teleported back to ancient Egypt n 300 BC. At there, you can see the pyramid, the guards and zombies. 
You are equipped with a sniper. 
On the table you have a magnifier, binocular and some sci-fi guns. Most of them are for decoration except the magnifier, you can grab it.
There is a couple of zombies hidden on the scene (on the right near the cat statues) and you have to you use gun scope or magnifier to see. 
You are not supposed to jump out of the carpet. If you trying to do so, you would die and the game is over.
The people do not harm you but you can still shoot at them if you want cuz you are a villian.

**NOTES:** This project still get a bug that regardless how far the range I set for the sniper, it cannot shoot down the far away objects so in this project we can only shoot the near objects.
Therefore, I make the guardian/the lich (only 1 lich) move towards to the player then we can shoot. The black dot displays what's the gun is targetting.
